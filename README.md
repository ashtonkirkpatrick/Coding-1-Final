# Coding-1-Final
 These are the starter files for S2021 Coding 1
My site is about mountains in the United States. I changed your photos and used different ones. The rest of the site is what the assignment told me to do. I can't think right now. I really did try my best. I added borders to the pictures and styled my information. I added fonts and colors to my information. There is also color around the pictures on the border. I changed the words in the nav bar and changed the title of the pages. The pictures are a little blurry but I dont know what to do about that.
